# Statistical-Spinner
This software aims to find statistically alternative writings of any word. It basically scans the parallel translations and scores the possibilities of words alternative writing.

## Code Example
Class can be defined with ```new Spinner(DATABASE_PATH);```
DATABASE_PATH should be the path of parallel translation text file. Please visit http://www.manythings.org/anki/ address to download parallel translation files for different language pairs.

After defining class you'll be able to use it with ```transform``` function.

It should be like that :

```$spinner->transform('I will eat food when possible');```


##Â Example
When we put that sentence into transformer, it returns as possible alternatives of words with score information.

Original : 
```I will eat food when possible```

Spun :
```When possible i am going to eat food```

We need parallel translation database to transform words. We use Dutch language to calculate scores because of similarity of English-Dutch language pairs.

## About
This project, basically a branch of statistical machine translation on PHP repository. You could find more detail on this page : https://github.com/devcem/NMT-on-PHP

## Credits
This project is developing by A.I. Spinner. In that repository we only share some parts of project and small dataset. To get better results, software needs larger datasets.
